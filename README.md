P4Pir is an in-network traffic analysis framework in IoT gateway, leveraging in-network ML inference for accurate detection and fast mitigation of emerging attacks. 

This repo is a simplified version of the demo.

## Prepare your environment

This demo is based on [BMv2](https://github.com/p4lang/behavioral-model) in Ubuntu 20.04.

Please make sure the following packages are installed by running: 
```
$ pip3 install -r ./requirements.txt
```
ðŸ’¡ To run the demo on Raspberry Pi, please follow the [P4Pi](https://github.com/p4lang/p4pi) guideline to configure the environment. 

## Run a simple demo
To run this code: 
1. Compile and run the BMv2 environment:
```
$ make clean && make run
```

2. Open a new terminal to run the controller:
```  
$ python3 conroller_cleaned.py
```
3. Back to the BMv2 terminal and generate some traffic:
```
mininet> sh timeout 15 tcpreplay -i s1-eth1 ./Data/EDGEIIOT/DDoSTCPSYN.pcap
```

* The source of the pcap capture and dataset: [Edge-IIoTset](http://ieee-dataport.org/8939)
